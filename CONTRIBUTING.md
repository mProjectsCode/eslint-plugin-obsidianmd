We're still experimenting with contributions, if you have any questions, please hop onto the [#ESLint plugin thread under #plugin-dev channel](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1379041736315240518) on our Discord.

You have to agree to the [Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/cla.md) which grants Obsidian the license to use your code.

### Code standards

- Keep it lightweight. The fewer the dependencies, the better. For example, please do not import `lodash` to use two functions from it.
- Your code should be self-explanatory. Class and function names should explain most things, but you should add comments for anything non-obvious. Also add examples in your comments to describe any unusual conversion that has to be done.
